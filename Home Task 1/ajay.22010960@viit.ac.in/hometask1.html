            <h3> <b> MIs young spinners Kumar Kartikeya  </b></h3>
            <p>posted on 29 june, 2022 (sports)</p>
            <p> Australian legendary Chinaman bowler Bradd Hogg was seen imparting his 
                knowledge on spin bowling to the young Mumbai Indian’s spinners Kumar 
                Kartikeya and Raghav Goyal during a practice session in the ongoing 
                Indian Premiere League season.“He is one of my favourite bowlers and 
                I admired him since my childhood. He is a very positive person. 
                Like…. he used to tell me, how he fights every situation and he told me
                a few things about how to stay positive every time and how to pick up
                yourself and how to push yourself. So I learnt a lot from him,” said 
                young left-arm orthodox spinner Raghav Goyal.

            <p>posted on 9 July, 2022 (Health)</p>
            <p> Apart from the respiratory system, COVID-19 can also impact your heart. 
                Responding to several recent deaths among youngsters in connection with heart 
                attacks, health minister Mansukh Mandaviya told NDTV, "We saw so many young 
                artistes, athletes, sportspersons...they died on stage while performing. 
                We all saw that, and reports started coming in from several places. 
                We needed to investigate."As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak 
                havoc worldwide, researchers and healthcare professionals are still 
                trying to understand the long-term effects of the disease on patients.

            <h3> <b> ChatGPT and AI are transforming education  </b></h3>
            <p>posted on 12 August, 2022 (Education)</p>
            <p>The transformation of education by ChatGPT and AI can be seen in 
                various ways. These technologies are bringing in innovative changes 
                to the traditional education system, making it more engaging, 
                personalised, and accessible to students all over the world.
                Artificial Intelligence has been around for decades, but its impact on
                education has been limited due to the lack of accessibility and 
                affordability. However, in the last 4 months, access to AI and ChatGPT
                has become more widespread and affordable, creating a huge wave in
                education.
