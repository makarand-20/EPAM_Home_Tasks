                    <p class="txt">RAKESH PATIL / APRIL 05, 2023 / 04:30 PM IST</p>
                    <p class="txt2">The Indian equity markets extended their winning streak for a fourth straight session on April 5, supported by capital goods, FMCG and information technology shares. At close, the Sensex was up 582.87 points or 0.99 percent at 59,689.31, while the Nifty gained 159 points or 0.91 percent at 17,557. After a muted start, the bulls took full control and extended the gains as the day progressed, with Sensex inching closer to 60,000 and Nifty above 17,550, intraday. Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy Committee (MPC) is going to announce their decision on interest rates tomorrow.<br>
                        <br>"The domestic market is displaying resilience, unaffected by the weaker global peers, thanks to strong banks and NBFCs quarterly numbers and the windfall tax cut. Additionally, the recent US data revealed a softening in the labour market and declining factory orders, increasing the likelihood of a pause in rate hikes by the Federal Reserve," said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.</p><br>

                    <p class="txt2">HCL technologies traded 1 percent lower on Wednesday after foreign brokerage firm JPMorgan placed it on its negative catalyst watch ahead of the Q4FY23 earnings likely to be released on April 20. The brokerage has cited high, near-term risks for the company and expects it to negatively surprise analysts. The brokerage remains cautious on the overall IT sector and sees downside risks to earnings and multiples from the weak fourth quarter prints and FY24 guidance. <br>
                        <br>“For Q4FY23, we expect HCL results to be the weakest in our coverage universe in terms of CC QoQ growth at just -1.9 percent due to weak seasonality at product and platform business,” says ICICI Securities which has a ‘hold’ rating on the company.</p><br>
